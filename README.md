# MNIST-Playground
This is my first Data Science end-to-end project.

This is a simple playground for the MNIST data, where you can draw a number and you can see the prediction for that draw.
This page uses a convolutional neural network to predict the digit.

You can find the web app code in src folder, and you can see the notebook model.ipynb where the model is computed.

Here you can see the Colab Notebook where where the convolutional neural net is computed: [![Open All Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14A5snwtyc9Nv5lqBtesoyTKlwIUNx8th/view?usp=sharing)

Here is the final result:
